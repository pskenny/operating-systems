# Lab 3

This lab focuses on the Java Thread and ThreadGroup classes. Super boring, super simple. Uses language feature `synchronised` for sync, no surprise. Code/course material provided by Mr Martin Hynes.

## Running
`javac [filename].java` then `java [filename].class` to run. Tested using JDK 8.

## TestThread Explaination
Use of threads extending Thread class.

## TestRunnable Explaination
Use of threads implementing Runnable class.

## ThPool ex
First use of ThreadPool to manage multiple threads

## PiggyBankWithoutSync
No sync on methods, data gets all messed up.

## PiggyBankWithSync
Uses sync on methods to make sure data NOT messed up. Used in contrast with previous example to show how to manage data safely.
